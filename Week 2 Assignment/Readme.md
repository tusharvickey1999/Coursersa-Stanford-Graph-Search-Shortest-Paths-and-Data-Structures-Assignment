#Dijsktra Single Source Shortest Path  
This algorithm is designed to calculate shortest distance between a source and all other vertices in the graph.  
We can implement this algorithm using array(O(m*n)) or heap(O(m*logn)) but heap implementation gives better run time.  
For the given testcase:  
Running time : 0.01 seconds  
Memory : less than 100 MB
