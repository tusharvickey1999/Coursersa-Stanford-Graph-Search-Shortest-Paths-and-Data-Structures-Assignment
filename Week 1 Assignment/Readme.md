The file consist of the solution to the assignment in the Coursera | Stanford Algorithm-2 Week 1  
Strong Connected Components  
The algorithm taught by the instructor is a recursive algorithm which is not possible to implement in python due to the restriction in recursion limit.  
So this implementation is based on iterative algorithm which can be implemented using Stack data structure. Everything else is same to what taught in the course.  
I have used deque for implementing stack from collection package which reduced run time from 5 mins to 20 sec.  
Running time : less than 20 seconds to run on the given test case  
Memory : Took 1.5 gb RAM
