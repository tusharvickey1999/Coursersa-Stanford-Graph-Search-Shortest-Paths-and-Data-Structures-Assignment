The file consist of the solution to the assignment in the Coursera | Stanford Algorithm-2 Week 1  
Strong Connected Components 
The algorithm taught by the intructor is a recursive algorithm which is not possible to implement in python due to the restriction in recursion limit.  
So this implementation is based iterative algorithm which can be implemented using Stack data structure.
